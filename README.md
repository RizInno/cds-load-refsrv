# Reference Server
This server acts as reference implementation and baseline for the client side test tool. 

The tool provides a simple test server to evaluate the varying settings. To prepare the server, execute the following:
1. Clone the repository to your machine
2. Execute the dependency installation in the main directory `npm i`
3. Either run the server via `cds watch` or build and deploy it to the SAP BTP.
